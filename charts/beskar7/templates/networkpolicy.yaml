# NOTE: The namespace-scoped allow policy has been removed because:
# 1. It was too restrictive, only allowing egress within the namespace
# 2. It blocked the controller from reaching the Kubernetes API server  
# 3. The manager-specific policy already provides proper egress controls
# 4. Having overlapping NetworkPolicies can cause unexpected denials
#
# The beskar7-manager NetworkPolicy provides all necessary rules.
