### Migration Guide

#### For Existing Users

**This release is NOT backward compatible. A complete redeployment is required.**

##### What to Do Before Upgrading
1. **Backup existing resources**: Export all Beskar7Machine and PhysicalHost resources
2. **Document configurations**: Note any custom configurations or workarounds
3. **Plan downtime**: This is a clean-break upgrade requiring full redeployment

##### Migration Steps
1. **Set up iPXE infrastructure**
   - Configure iPXE boot server (HTTP-based)
   - Deploy DHCP with iPXE chainloading
   - Host inspection image and target OS images
   - See `docs/ipxe-setup.md` for complete guide
2. **Deploy beskar7-inspector image**
   - Build or pull beskar7-inspector:1.0
   - Host inspection image on HTTP server
   - Configure inspection endpoint URL
3. **Update CRDs**
   - Delete old CRDs (they are incompatible)
   - Apply new CRDs from v0.4.0-alpha manifests
4. **Recreate resources**
   - Convert Beskar7Machine specs to new format
   - Remove: `imageURL`, `configURL`, `osFamily`, `provisioningMode`, `bootMode`
   - Add: `inspectionImage`, `targetOSImage`
   - Adjust hardware requirements if needed
5. **Redeploy Beskar7 controller**
   - Use new v0.4.0-alpha manifests
   - Ensure inspection endpoint is accessible from hosts
   - Monitor logs for inspection workflow

##### What Will NOT Work
- Any ISO-based provisioning configurations
- VirtualMedia references in PhysicalHost specs
- RemoteConfig or PreBakedISO provisioning modes
- Legacy PXE (TFTP) configurations
- Vendor-specific workarounds or BIOS settings
- BootMode selection (UEFI only)

##### What You Gain
- **Simpler architecture**: Easier to understand and troubleshoot
- **No vendor lock-in**: Generic iPXE + kexec workflow works everywhere
- **Better observability**: Hardware inspection provides rich details
- **Faster provisioning**: Direct network boot, no ISO mounting delays
- **Reduced complexity**: No more vendor quirks or BIOS manipulation
- **Cleaner code**: 2000+ lines removed, easier to contribute to

### Statistics

- **Code Changes**: 50+ files modified
- **Lines Removed**: 2000+ lines of complex code deleted
- **Lines Added**: 1500+ lines of new inspection workflow
- **Documentation**: 10+ files updated, 5 obsolete docs removed
- **Tests**: 26 unit tests passing, 11 deferred to hardware phase
- **CI Workflows**: All 7 workflows passing
- **Linter Errors Fixed**: 330+ errors resolved
- **Breaking Changes**: Major version bump warranted

### Known Limitations

#### Hardware Testing Pending
- **Real Hardware Validation**: Inspection workflow not yet tested on physical servers
- **Deferred Tests**: 11 integration tests marked as pending, require hardware
- **Kexec Validation**: Kexec boot into final OS not validated end-to-end
- **Network Stack**: Network persistence from inspection to final OS not tested

#### Future Work
- Hardware testing on real servers (Dell, HP, Supermicro, etc.)
- Performance benchmarking of inspection workflow
- Additional hardware detection (GPU, RAID controllers, etc.)
- Inspection timeout tuning based on real-world data
- Documentation improvements based on field testing feedback

### Acknowledgments

This release represents a complete rethinking of Beskar7's architecture, prioritizing simplicity and reliability over feature breadth. The decision to remove VirtualMedia support was made after extensive experience showing it to be unreliable and vendor-specific.

Special thanks to the Cluster API community for the excellent foundation, and to the iPXE and Alpine Linux projects for enabling this simplified workflow.

### Notes

**Why This Major Refactoring?**

The previous architecture (v0.3.4-alpha) relied heavily on Redfish VirtualMedia, which proved to be:
- Unreliable across vendors (Dell, HP, Supermicro all behave differently)
- Complex to implement (300+ lines of vendor-specific workarounds)
- Slow to provision (ISO mounting and BMC limitations)
- Hard to debug (black-box BMC behavior)

The new iPXE + inspection workflow is:
- Vendor-agnostic (standard PXE boot + HTTP)
- Simple to implement (no vendor quirks)
- Fast (direct network boot, no ISO overhead)
- Observable (rich inspection data, clear phases)

This is a **clean break** from the past, setting Beskar7 on a path toward production readiness.
