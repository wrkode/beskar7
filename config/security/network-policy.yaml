# NOTE: The beskar7-allow-namespace-communication policy has been removed because:
# 1. It was too restrictive, only allowing egress within beskar7-system namespace
# 2. It blocked the controller from reaching the Kubernetes API server
# 3. The beskar7-manager-network-policy already provides proper egress controls
# 4. Having overlapping NetworkPolicies can cause unexpected denials
#
# If you need additional namespace-level restrictions, ensure they don't conflict
# with the manager's need to reach:
# - Kubernetes API server (for leader election, resource management)
# - External BMC endpoints (for Redfish communication)
# - DNS services (for name resolution)
