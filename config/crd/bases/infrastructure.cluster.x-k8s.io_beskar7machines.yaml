                  "PreBakedISO": The ImageURL points to an ISO that already has the configuration embedded.
                  If omitted and ConfigURL is provided, "RemoteConfig" is assumed.
                  If omitted and ConfigURL is not provided, "PreBakedISO" is assumed (though an image without config might not be useful).
                enum:
